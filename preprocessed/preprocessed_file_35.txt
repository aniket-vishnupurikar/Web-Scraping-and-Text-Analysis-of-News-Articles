application code review checklist introduction the definition consciousness controversial centuries hence given title familiar yet mysterious aspects lives . an idea concept would awareness beings surroundings perception. the reason part mind remains unascertained consciousness observable unlike brain matter studied scientifically. physical clarification awareness general sense incomplete include feels subject subject. there likewise accounts unbridgeable illustrative gap physical world consciousness. as suggested incident eastern shamir traditions consciousness universal primal. whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years research able answer questions relating nature emotions experiences. history beginning within late nineteenth century time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind typically equated consciousness. as result analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain. the ancient mayans among first propose sorted feeling degree consciousness purpose worldly association mankind. since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature well interior stimuli mayans trusted essential type existence equipped evolution. the incas however thought consciousness movement mindfulness well worry others too. john locke early philosopher said consciousness individuality freelanced substances. he also detected reason believe consciousness stuck specific body mind consciousness cannot transferred one body mind different one. karl marx another early thinker denies mind body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one settings. william james american psychologist differentiated consciousness stream unbroken continuous despite several changes shifts. while main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors throughout primary half twentieth century analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s. in sigmund freud psychoanalytic theory see believed three levels awareness preconscious conscious unconscious responsible one behavior thinking. he believed mid divided three parts id ego superego. the id present birth instinctual operates according pleasure principle. the ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. finally superego internalization society moral standards responsible guilt. now id regarded unconscious whereas ego superego also conscious preconscious. freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches however conduct scientific experiments hence work heavily scrutinized leaving questions unanswered. sigmund freud theory differed psychologists since theories understandable easily conveyed people. sigmund freud work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth character memory sexuality therapy. however theories subject considerable criticism life. whilst john locke william james took practical approach mystery conducting experiments sigmund freud provide evidence support claims. brain today essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally. issues interest include phenomena perception blindsight brainwaves sleep altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs. a greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters. however confirm criticalness verbal reports researchers must contrast action happens brain search neural connections consciousness. hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain particular pattern global brain activity greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness. a brain imaging strategies example eeg mri scans utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations. a investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain adequate create consciousness workable subjects report absence awareness event areas example primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus. higher brain areas viewed encouraging particularly prefrontal cortex involved range high order functions. one mainstream theory implicates various examples brain waves creating various conditions consciousness. analysts record mind waves drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum using electroencephalograph eeg placing electrodes scalp. the four types brain waves alpha beta theta delta correspond one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep deeply asleep memory episodic memory regarded form conscious memory. this capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past. the hippocampus located brain temporal lobe responsible type memory. consciousness also plays part important memory distinctions. one distinction implicit explicit characteristics explicit memory consciously know implicit memory includes events may conscious of. furthermore several empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness. working memory operates maintains consciously perceived information well since temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks. the current ways testing information lacking several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution scope. examples methods pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etc. pet fmri temporal resolution problems eeg well known localizability difficulties implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons restricted scope. hence huge numbers speculations testable fundamental level appear difficult test now. mental illness consciousness influence way see objects around us encourages us settle choices communicate them. experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems example agnosia failure decipher visual data alzheimer disease autism. however actually comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object. several different disorders consciousness include locked syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma brain death. locked syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma condition wherein patient aware however move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body aside vertical eye developments squinting. the individual conscious able speak eye movements. in minimally conscious state patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness. patients need give restricted however reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance. this could following straightforward orders comprehensible speech purposeful conduct. in persistent vegetative state patient sleep wake cycles lacks awareness able communicate displays reflexive non purposeful behavior. the term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourse like coma chronic coma results generally cortical white matter harm neuronal axonal injury central brainstem sores. usually metabolism grey matter decreases 50 70 normal range. the patient lies eyes shut know self environmental factors. brain death irreversible end brain activity function including involuntary activity necessary sustain life . the main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation. after brain death patient lacks sense awareness sleep wake cycles behavior typically look dead deep sleep state. future predictions conclusion as see history scholar endeavors study consciousness empirically nature one defined using scientific methods. in past psychologists descartes came dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics. in battle realists illusionists taking sides fundamentally impossible topic allow concrete evidence. as observe neural examinations brain detect causes consciousness sensory sector brain cause one aware certain event even clear signs reaction stimulus. similarly even though consciousness plays major role memory currently lack facilities research fully. in future possibility able access facilities however could allow us find neural connections ties mental illness well. not would help several people making us aware causes perspective certain things would also give us better chance recognizing signs possible mental illness issues beforehand. as seems researchers continue study unknown part mind able fund recover global pandemic able answer one psychology difficult questions. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven dashboards
