google app engine application code review checklist to begin i shall first like explain big data become important lives. big data simply data huge size. data voluminous also growing exponentially time. such data sets large complex possible store process using traditional data management tools. so huge data social media sites like facebook generate 500 terabytes new data every day form photos video uploads text messages etc. a single jet engine generate 10 terabytes data 30 minutes flight time. with many thousand flights per day generation data reaches many petabytes. data contained sets always structured. it semi structured even unstructured. when size dimension data well imagine complicated must process analyze it. therefore modern methods data analysis developed used process information contained big data sets. now coming opportunities big data provides limited healthcare. big data analysis disruptive technology intervened numerous fields proved worth. healthcare exception. big data potential change entire dynamics healthcare industry improve quality life people. healthcare industry large complicated system. it involves lot risks always demands better care. however large number patients seek emergency care complications well cost rise exponentially. in india many times even lack sufficient infrastructure support patients deficit beds well doctors provide treatment patients. for instance epidemics break lives lost alarming rate easily gauge helplessness. however scenario certainly improving now. with advent digitization healthcare system healthcare providers practitioners access huge amount patient health data. this healthcare big data processed analyzed identify patient patterns quickly effectively. the information obtained extremely useful figure chronic health issues provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand curb disease disorder occurring. this method also known predictive analysis one crucial benefits big data healthcare. this technology help healthcare industry ways infer. healthcare organizations implemented predictive analysis witnessed reduction er visits providing support care patients decreasing emergency situations. apart reduced er visits timely treatment many benefits big data predictive analysis. patients high risk life threatening issues provided customized treatment facilities. due lack data exists lack proper planning hospitals. under booking staff lack medical equipment medicines facilities result inefficient budgeting ill management finances. using predictive analysis problems solved lead reduced costs efficient management finances. better staff allocation admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement daily operations healthcare organizations. by using big data effect recency bias could reduced well. when give importance recent events tend ignore effect older ones may lead incorrect decisions. this known recency bias. big data also helps preventing fraudulent activities turn prevents losses insurance companies. while changing healthcare industry better easy reap benefits big data. there whole lot challenges vulnerabilities attached implementation. one biggest challenges security. healthcare big data contains personal information health history patients. acts hacking cyber theft phishing pose serious threat databases. such data could stolen sold huge sums money. protection patients privacy hence serious challenge big data implementation. also data would contain external data apart medical information. the organization therefore take care privacy legal compliances government policies. privacy security patients given utmost importance breach kind permitted. the next challenge data classification modeling. the size data massive less structured heterogeneous. classifying massive data identify relevant information big challenge. modeling unstructured data equally difficult. storage retrieval another major challenge. huge cloud servers sufficient space required store voluminous data. also speed high uploading data done hassle free. the way storage challenge retrieval also matter concern. integrating data getting relevant systems link tough job. the next challenge major one opinion. finding right talent expertise implement modern technology arduous task. shortage required talent crisis market today. even hiring right talent challenge retain them. scarce resources like data scientists hard find even harder retain. they easily poached competitors. a good efficient compensation strategy conducive work environment high incentives opportunities career growth development ways retaining intellectual talent. in nutshell conclude big data disruptive technology bring landmark changes healthcare dynamics challenges vulnerabilities need addressed utmost care sense responsibility. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven
