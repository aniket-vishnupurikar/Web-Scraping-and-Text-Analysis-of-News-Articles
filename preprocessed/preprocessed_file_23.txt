problems how setup custom domain google app engine application code review checklist data new oil become important trendline 21st century. the reason advancements fields related data analysis. the field ai machine learning statistics data mining deal data developing staggering pace fields become popular buzzwords days. buzzwords originated technical terms often underlying essence ignored fashionable use mainly used impress. this main reason misconception amongst people. ai ml stats data mining many fields related analysis data often mistook one thing thus words often used interchangeably convey one thing. but true the similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data information . in academics learning ai machine learning statistics data mining academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored case articles try explain difference. thus becoming primary cause confusion learners. hence article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions. the essential difference disciplines lies aims approach taken achieve aims. the aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities. then satisfy aim must first understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent the answer questions found studying intelligent agents best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror yes humans best examples intelligent entities. thus 1900s researchers began exploring thought process reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. mimicking human behavior became aim ai initial years research. after setting goal studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim turing test turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human level performance cognitive tasks sufficient fool interrogator. but test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence. because intelligence related working human brain without human brain intelligence meaning thus mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim. the field psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process. the difference ai tries understand thought process mimic build it. the collaboration fields resulted models neural networks try mimic function neurons present human brain. so basically initial aim human centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent. concurrently field computer science developing greater pace. with advances computer science experiments theories could easily tested validated. as programs applied solve real life problems found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans. one best examples could chess playing program. an ai program defeated world best chess player garry kasparov. this incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence else human would able defeat ai program. this leads question human intelligence ideal intelligence as computers became advanced proved better humans certain complex tasks. that new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems. so rather considering nature agents researchers began study nature intelligence itself. then question comes test validate intelligence the best way test intelligence solve cognitive problems. an agent said intelligent solve complex problem. the problem solving approach easily tested validated computers. thus researchers began studying ideal intelligence selected agent validate experiments computer. so computer problem solving approach adopted. so human centered approach computer problem solving approach two main aims ai. both fields contributed field giving valuable insights. both aims important collaboratively form main aim ai in problem solving approach big challenge ai overcome order achieve aim. consider example solving math problem. there two cases intelligence tested problem solving approach. let us say two math problems given solve. the first problem familiar second problem not. consider first problem. the first problem familiar means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past. so comes question mind able solve problem the answer solved similar problems past thus learned past data solve problems thus even seen problem past still able solve similar problems. this one form intelligence. consider another case given second problem solved kind problems past. then solve problem try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion. this kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. this second kind intelligence. for ai build intelligent agents kinds intelligence must developed agent. but reality ai reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information. ai today reached point build agents think own. that second type intelligence. so way ai able implement first type intelligence machine learning so domain ai focuses solely implementing first kind intelligence fact machine learning. that reason ml called subset ai so main difference ai ml. technically speaking it field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions patterns without explicitly programmed . this statement needs elaboration. the essence ml related process generalization learning past data. generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. consider humans recognize daily life objects. if see animal easily recognize dog cat . it trivial task us ever wondered mind able the answer generalization if given picture dog easily recognize picture dog minds abstracted description dog formulated concept dog concepts became better better learned past experiences dog. so way think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds. with generalization come real information . so try give computers ability generalize raw data convert information patterns trends data own. this discipline concerns collection organization analysis interpretation presentation data. statistics tries deal data aim explain it. so study explaining data statistics two main domains descriptive statistics inferential statistics. descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name descriptive statistics. it tries explain much information possible easily whole large data would complex task otherwise. inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data. we use inference many tasks daily lives. consider simple case cooking soup. after completing recipe taste small sample spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. depending upon result sample make inference whole soup soup whole good bad. similarly statistics cases apply inference meaningful information. for example consider case cannot gather whole data time consuming costly. in cases applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty. that inferential statistics come help. so use data context uncertainty decision making face uncertainty statistics deals with. so however whatever data statistics tries explain data. this aim resonate ai ml statistics help fields correctly interpret data data useful raw form. consider examples sensors used industrial applications. these sensors might used manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature pressure etc. the raw data generated sensors useful unless converted suitable form processed analyzed gather valuable insights used solve problem due unique aim capturing essence large datasets gather insights data mining also referred knowledge discovery . that carly fiorina former ceo hewlett packard said the goal turn data information information insight . this statement completely explains aim data mining so difference ai machine learning statistics data mining lies aims. but approaches taken fields help one way fulfilling aims fields. this beauty fields we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven dashboards
