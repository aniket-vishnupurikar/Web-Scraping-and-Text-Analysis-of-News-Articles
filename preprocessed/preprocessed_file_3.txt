google app engine application code review checklist anything could give rise smarter human intelligence form artificial intelligence brain computer interfaces neuroscience based human intelligence enhancement wins hands beyond contest change world. nothing else even league. eliezer yudkowsky ai researcher there denying robots automation increasingly part daily lives. just look around grocery store highway everywhere. this makes us wonder ai replace human intelligence what make relevant tomorrow let us try find answers questions more. let first understand artificial intelligence artificial intelligence ai basically machines displaying intelligence. this seen machine playing chess robot answering questions facebook. artificial intelligence broken many different types. there ais designed specific tasks detecting specific type cancer. however also ais multiple tasks driving car. there many types ais. among top important fields machine learning ml neural network computer vision natural language processing nlp. machine learning idea machines able prove similar human learns new skill. machine learning also allows optimization existing skill. machine learning used many different fields one application entertainment. netflix uses machine learning recommend shows watch based shows already seen. neural networks algorithms modeled human brain. these algorithms think like thereby give similar results human give. artificial neural networks used medical fields diagnose cancers like lung cancer prostate cancer. computer vision idea computers visions. this allows see things way human beings potentially better human beings depending programming camera used etc. computer vision used autonomous vehicles navigation one place another. natural language processing idea computers listen say. an example siri. siri able listen demands process means provide answer based researched. now know ai let talk issue. ais allow automation jobs thereby replacing humans already do. this means job loss concentration wealth selected people. this could mean destabilization society social unrest. in addition social unrest ai improves time. this means becomes smarter faster cheaper implement better repetitive things humans currently preparing fast food. it predicted ai improve much 50 100 years ai become super intelligent. this means become even smarter intelligent human earth. according many experts elon musk could cause end human civilization. ai could potentially start war humans burn crops sorts tragedies reserved human functions. at point theory stop ai would already thought obstacles prevent goal. this means cannot unplug machine effect ai replace human intelligence. but happen next 10 30 years no the field artificial intelligence sophisticated enough many human tasks humans currently do. currently ai smart enough empathetic humans cannot think strategically enough solve complex problems. ai solutions expensive go many different tests standards implement. it also takes time ai improve. for example boston dynamics one world top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk. fast forward 2019 robot could walk could jump objects backflips much more. in addition timing takes time price new technological solution drop point affordable. for example desktop computer costs around 1000 1999 get significantly powerful laptop exact price. ai go curve. but happens 10 30 years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe. as proven earlier ai become faster better cheaper. as happens companies use ai technology automate jobs save money increase productivity importantly stay competitive. as demonstrated ai become better repetition via use machine learning. the difference ai able learn faster time progresses due amount data available today. it also able learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks new important skills. however ai also repetitive routine tasks better also able understand emotional intelligence ethics creativity. this seen three distinct example ibm ibm uses ibm watson program ai create movie trailer. fox approached ibm said movie coming ai scifi horror. they asked ibm platform ibm watson could trailer reviewing watching footage searching scary sad happy moments movie provoked quality emotions based machine programmed identify emotions quantifiable manner. ibm watson able generate trailer movie morgan. the result movie trailer created machines example google in 2018 google demonstrated ai assistance could take calls simple stuff. the ai able set appointment what fascinating able understand nuances conversation. the receptionist thought human calling her. that primitive version possible technology. eventually able conversations human beings making many sales jobs obsolete. example ai generated art in 2018 paris art collective consisting three students used artificial intelligence generate portrait. it generated portrait painting studying set fifteen thousand art images wiki art. it estimated worth seven thousand ten thousand dollars. the painting sold auction four thirty five thousand us dollars. however cannot sure say ai replace human intelligence. this society started asking hard questions questioning ethics. elon musk founded open ai research lab whose whole purpose promote discover artificial intelligence way benefits humanity. in addition many factors affect long term outcome ai replacing human intelligence. like degree humans allow ai take depending field people even want artificial intelligence help or prefer human counterpart while may able control happens long run definitely secure short term future. strategic creative thinking the ability think outside box human. there thousands upon thousands slightly different possible outcomes may result every distinguishable action human mind ability judge experience programmed purposes far sophisticated manner ai currently achieve. as billionaire founder alibaba jack ma famously said ai logic human beings wisdom . conflict resolution negotiations with understanding complexities human related processes ability improvise judge far better equipped deal conflicts robots ever likely be. ai may able recognize faces images rarely successfully read feelings faces. humans lesser greater degrees capable accurate analysis emotional subtext. with application intuition use delicately worded elusive languages methods able properly judge person feels. interpretation gray areas robots computers function well presented quantifiable data. however situation enters gray area whether term refers morals processes definitions robots likely falter. critical thinking humans capable responding indicators quality computers are. while ai system may able analyze documents according true false statements made within text judge whether well written analyze implication use certain words overall meaning content. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven dashboards applications development information management organizations combining unique specialist services high lvel human expertise. contact us hello
