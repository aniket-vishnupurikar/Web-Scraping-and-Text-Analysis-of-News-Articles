application code review checklist nature blessed humanity earth rounded globe essential necessity lies hand human. though 21st century building space shuttle exploring space become obvious activity among human raise inclusion start ups like space x dreamed reaching space coming true. we agree upon fact growth industrialization generated humungous carbon footprint colonize outer space create much needed area survival. with time human race visualized undergone many transformations transformations may starters effective major role existence age. be natural transformation like shifting tectonic plates manmade like dumping water damaging water bodies somehow affected usual life humans creating space humans next humans eyeing for. all idea colonizing outer space emerged nasa able launch space shuttle heavy payload late 1990s idea stir brain time later like apple eyes various articles astronauts writeup came limelight idea saw progression space exploration new normal companies petrified number investments kinds projects ask for. but things change entry paypal owner elon musk 2002 laid stones space x nasa providing launchpad exploration. being space travel legitimate many bottlenecks knowing nature outer space boost idea colonizing one realize optimum. but main target company put forward themself get planet get back earth safely earlier projects due high fund always subdued priority given rocket technology. thus unimaginable quest search space far fetched though. now 2020 find place colonizing outside space kind emergence technologies led escalation spreading roots human existence plan reaching outer space plays key role idea too. proper planning analysing organising executing required projects successful deeper know i would like mention example space x according wud successful sending rockets 2022 would able colonize 2050 for achieving vision planned total 36 times pre launch rocket launching 2020. not already placed star link satellites provide basic network connectivity colonized world planned extent targeted profit 22 billion yearly 2025. already sent first manned rocket successfully elon musk plan create infrastructure going mars cost regular air flight ticket lead better chances colonizing another planet. with setting commercial flight started red planet wud stepping stone colonizing outer space. but fundamental change people undergo living another planet change gravity able near live support technical issues arise suit unless find similar place like earth change humans adjust. aspects like ultraviolet rays play immense role survival rate technology expanding challenging boundaries many days left find solutions aspects idea colonizing monetary terms projected building colony space cost 10 trillian many countries gdp. placing much amount getting funding highly anticipated projects tough. elon addressed questions open door believes cost nothing find route colonize space costs justifiable space exploration reach new heights. also world around water percentage land comparison water less. whereas population increasing speed level excitement order search new things obsession new innovative things never going finish. because end satisfy achieved looking things crave achieve that. in order achieve planning crucial stage. as searched 9 planets still shortlisted outcomes. but according 3 decade theory elon musk seems possible. as important thing survive atmospheric environment whether suitable order make suitable steps take maintain suitable level oxygen. the missions everyone focusing about. finding source water 2nd crucial thing needed survive. apart excitement things threats uncertainties bound happen like kind mammal could occur construction that. so security protection uncertainties could replicated. after basic things factors like natural habitats available whether plants could grown not. if yes types plants could survive there. the environment animals safe not. because balance nature need types animals natural habitat even insects small things seems ignorable plays important role maintaining environmental balance. for e.g. ants among leading predators insects helping keep pest populations low. ants move approximately amount soil earthworms loosening soil process increasing air water movement ground. they keep ecosystem clean dead insect carcasses aid destruction decomposition plant animal matter. so every small thing contributes way. another matter concern level artificial intelligence machine learning required maintain kind requirement. because current scenario need energy run vehicle even robotics. so availability energy source energy needed. and apart heat sun equally important order maintain level. because artificial air survive long. so order remain healthy well calculation done. when thinking disease may heard news concern antibiotics penicillin help fight infections may eventually stop working. global health organisations trying reduce use antibiotics especially conditions serious. this overuse recent years means becoming less effective. but still survive without antibiotics. because ways dealing diseases caused bacteria isolation treated penicillin. it might sound like something set firmly realm fantasy experts private industry governments around world trying understand feasible would establish lunar base. some scientists think humans could survive comfortably moon. in ways minimal gravity moon might actually conducive life microgravity astronauts experience international space station. although formally tested experts hypothesize small amount gravitational force put astronaut body moon could help stem adverse effects like bone density muscle loss space flyers experience living microgravity international space station. by using moon indigenous material space agencies save money cost flying pricey missions moon surface. once moon instead stage costly missions aimed delivering oxygen necessary resources earth experts might able actually use material manufacture gasses needed sustain life satellite. on earth protected radioactive solar winds cosmic rays magnet field known magnetosphere. but space rely type protection order make protection could take lot yes upgraded technology could achieve. although till approximate value project 10 trillion. but aim make fare equivalent normal air fare. as comfortable resources securities uncertainties risk analysis probability survival human many factors consideration development take much time. because construct building take normally 8 9 months. which totally acceptable. but main concern density land i.e. whether land capacity bear much weight not. and type land adaptable cultivation nor. although land converted different types cultivation help upgraded technology. in order transport equipments regular basis large amount fuel is required factors well built propellor depo rocket landing building various infrastructure city one one create way forward idea colonizing
