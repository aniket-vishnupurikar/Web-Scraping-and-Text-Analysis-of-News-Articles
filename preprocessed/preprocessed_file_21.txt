important impacts covid 19 pandemic environment. there positive impacts environment due lockdown like air pollution decreased dramatically people asked stay houses due lockdowns. there also sharp

it one important challenges modern era noise pollution cause adverse effects humans well harm many animals too. the imposition lockdown quarantine various nation governments caused people remain back homes. because movement people one place different place reduced significantly use personal public transport also decreased. due changes environmental noise generated cities dropped substantially. water pollution beaches reduced significantly many animals spotted back cities covid 19 virus also generated many negative indirect effect environment. to begin developed countries halted sustainability program pandemic. in united states many european nation states waste recycling plants suspended many municipalities cities due concern virus getting spread recycling centers. this resulted increase use single use plastic bags instead usable bags many leading restaurants firms corporations. for instance starbucks leading coffee company month march 2020 announced short lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups. furthermore people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores shops restaurants food outlets closed making online purchase food delivery quite high. this

generated outbreak wuhan. these organic inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment cause environmental issues like water pollution air pollution soil erosion harm local flora fauna. the demand masks pandemic become skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non woven fabrics. polyester polystyrene polyethylene polycarbonate common materials used surgical mask density lying 20grams 25 grams sq. meter. these materials mostly resistant liquids plastic based products really high afterlife discarded. if treated properly without discarding end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. for example recently environment hong kong started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes. with recycling plants hold piles small mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated every day. this makes surrounding vulnerable also creating high risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays methane ch4 greenhouse gas hence increasing risk global warming too. not surroundings getting affected careless methods local people also getting affected. if excess methane gets accumulated earth atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes could result increases earth average temperature harmful future generations. many protected endangered flora fauna facing much greater risks due imposition lockdown. many countries lockdown made people stay inside homes. the employees ngos volunteers working protected areas

evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater well drinking water. despite fact excessive amounts chlorine water cause harmful problems issues associated people health like bladder cancer also damages cells. the covid 19 reminder health planet also linked health humans. evidence proves virus zoonotic meaning transmitted people animals. they accountable seventy five percent emerging infectious diseases world. with virus infecting millions people every day across globe various governments agencies top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes especially clinical medical waste . likewise time responsible individuals need step follow necessary guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears. in spite various data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic history witnessed rise pollution post financial crisis . a similar case observed 2008 financial crash although temporary decrease emissions 1.3 observed economy recovered 2010 emissions time high. after sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. to prevent future outbreaks must address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife including habitat loss illegal trade pollution climate change human life depends earth life. if live near spacious outdoor area like desert empty road lined trees realize safe surface less space take walk begin realize beauty nature. the point remain indoors avoid close contact others. when leave home whether walk desert run street make sure wipe surfaces come contact avoid touching face frequently wash
