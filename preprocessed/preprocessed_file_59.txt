climate world many ways. the economic downturn puts pressure global oil prices leading organization petroleum exporting countries opec consider cuts production. it hurts demand natural gas time extremely low prices. it changes economic energy climate policymaking environment china one consequential energy consumers sources greenhouse gas emissions. and temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout energy industry including renewable energy time supply chain connections china revaluated due ongoing tariff trade disputes. how consequential transformative changes energy sector climate efforts depend upon ultimate trajectory virus outbreak sarah ladislaw senior vice president director energy security climate change program the energy sector already felt impacts coronavirus. the outbreak contributed dampened demand oil resulting plummeting oil prices production declines. as move forward energy sector expects face two headwinds managing issues health emergency sectors face simultaneously coping low oil price scenario lower demand need shore revenue manage debt obligations. impact of covid 19 on indian energy markets in india distribution utilities lower tariff domestic agricultural consumers sometimes even average cost supply compared commercial industrial consumers. table 1 provides electricity tariff rates delhi selected consumer categories highlight differences. thus several distribution companies lower tariff paying consumers cross subsidized commercial industrial consumers. the covid 19 lockdown led shut essential commercial activities across country. approximately 1.3 billion citizens obliged remain within confines homes many cases allowed work home. consequently electricity demand industrial commercial customers reduced significantly residential

especially without long term ppas would adversely impacted given weakening power tariffs short term power exchange market said icra ratings sector head vice president girishkumarkadam.the construction renewable power projects well epc manufacturing companies solar segment likely face execution delays disruption supply chain india labor availability following lockdown. given import dependency china sourcing pv modules execution timelines ongoing solar projects likely affected delays delivery pv modules following outbreak covid 19 china. this delay turn would increase pre operative expenses overall project cost turn would impact expected returns. in context mnre notified time extension provided renewable energy projects impacted supply chain disruption due covid outbreak force majeure
