application code review checklist machine intelligence last invention humanity ever need make nick bostrom to put frankly artificial intelligence eventually replace jobs. workers variety industries healthcare agriculture manufacturing expect witness hiring disruptions result artificial intelligence. if history taught us anything disruptive paradigm shifting business ideas make fortune innovators also build groundwork new business models market entrants job opportunities inevitably follow. it true robots today future eventually replace humans many jobs innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. but mean jobs humans end here. we hand required generate provide value whole new ways entirely new business models result changes. according 71 businesses worldwide artificial intelligence help people overcome critical challenging problems live better lives. artificial intelligence consultants work equally fair according whopping 83 corporate leaders. these results demonstrate artificial intelligence steadily extending measures yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives. since advent industry 4.0 businesses moving fast pace towards automation type industry. in 2013 researchers oxford university study future work. they concluded almost one every two jobs high risk automated machines. machine learning responsible disruption. it powerful branch artificial intelligence. it allows machines learn data mimic things humans do. a research conducted employees kaggle wherein algorithm created take images human eye diagnose eye disease known diabetic retinopathy. here winning algorithm could match diagnosis given human ophthalmologists. another study conducted wherein algorithm created grade high school essays. here winning algorithm could match grade given human teachers. thus safely conclude given right data machines easily outperform human beings tasks like these. a teacher might read 10 000 essays 40 year career ophthalmologist might see 50 000 eyes machine read million essays see million eyes within minutes. thus convenient conclude chance competing machines frequent high volume tasks. tasks machines work but tasks human beings upper hand novel tasks. machines handle things seen many times before. the fundamental rule machine learning learns large volumes past data. but humans ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems seen before. percy spencer physicist working radar world war 2 noticed magnetron melting chocolate bar. here able connect understanding electromagnetic radiation knowledge cooking order invent microwave oven. now sort cross pollination happens one us several times day. thus machines cannot compete us comes tackling novel situations. now know around 92 talented professionals believe soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter much hard skills successful managing workplace. perhaps kind tasks machines never compete humans at. also creative tasks copy behind marketing campaign needs grab customers attention stand crowd. business strategy means finding gaps market accordingly working them. since machines cannot outperform humans novel tasks humans would creating campaigns strategies. human contact would essential care giving educational related work responsibilities technology would take backseat. health screenings customer service face face communication would advocate human contact artificial intelligence playing supporting role. so mean future work the future state single job lies answer one single question extent job reducible tackling frequent high volume tasks extent involve tackling novel situations today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers coming years going conduct audits going read boilerplate legal contracts. but mean going needing accountants lawyers wrong. we still going need complex tax structuring path breaking litigation. it get tougher get jobs machine learning shrink ranks. amazon recruited 100 000 robots warehouses help move goods products around effectively warehouse workforce expanded 80 000 people. humans pick pack goods amazon 480 000 000 products shelves robots move orders throughout enormous warehouses therefore reducing amount walking required workers making amazon pickers efficient less exhausted. furthermore amazon longer requires aisle space humans robots enable amazon pack shelves together like cars rush hour traffic. more inventory one roof offers better selection customers higher density shelf space equals inventory one roof. kodak undisputed giant photography industry 90 share usa market 1976 1984 employing 1 45 000 people. but year 2012 net worth negative 1 billion declare bankruptcy. why because failed predict importance exponential trends comes technology. on hand instagram digital photography company started 2012 13 employees later sold facebook 1 billion. this ironic kodak pioneered digital photography actually invented first digital camera unfortunately thought mere product pay attention towards created problem. we live era artificial intelligence ai given us tremendous computing power storage space information access. we given spinning wheel first electricity second computers third industrial revolution exponential growth technology. airbnb giant start known enabling homeowners rent homes couches travellers example creating new artificial intelligence system empower designers product engineers literally take ideas drawing board convert actual products almost instantly. this might significant breakthrough whether designer engineer type technologist. differences automation brings onto table there three key changes automation bring macro level artificial intelligence fad. tractica market research firm published report 2016 predicted annual global revenue artificial intelligence products services expand 643.7 million 2016 36.8 billion 2025 57 fold increase time span. as result it industry fastest growing segment size. the reduction need people result artificial intelligence related technologies resulted job layoffs cause fear. in india alone job losses it sector reportedly reached 1 000 last year owing integration new advanced technologies like artificial intelligence machine learning. most it companies infosys wipro tcs cognizant reduced employee base india recruiting less engaging personnel united states investing heavily centres innovation. artificial intelligence data science currently trending aspects require fewer people primarily located abroad helping prospects local employees. another factor computer industry continuously growing would develop size two million workers. unfortunately drop bucket compared robots information technology less skilled brothers. large e commerce sites used operated armies people manned 200 robots produced greyorange indian company based gurgaon. these indefatigable robots lift stack boxes 24 hours day 30 minute break recharging cut employees 80 . for efficiency victory disaster job prospects. internal skilling redeployment staff critical requirement hour. artificial intelligence presented indian policymakers epistemological scientific ethical issues. this requires us abandon regular linear non disruptive mental patterns. the tale artificial intelligence influence individuals occupations told time. it us upskill look ways stay current industry current trends demands. so machines able take many jobs the answer resounding yes. however every job taken robots equal number positions available people do. some human vocations artistic nature. others necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. humans machines form symbiotic relationships assisting best. in future people machines may able collaborate work together towards common goal business work for. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven dashboards applications development information management organizations combining unique specialist services high lvel human expertise. contact us hello blackcoffer.com all right reserved
