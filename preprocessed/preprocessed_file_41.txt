internet demand evolution communication impact 2035 alternative pathways rise cybercrime effect upcoming future ai ml predictive modeling solution contact centre problems how setup custom domain google app engine application code review checklist when talk ai different people different perspectives it. there one group people good knowledge real potential ai believe ai novel solution many problems world facing today. there another group people merely threatened thought ai taking world. the field ai took birth alan turing 1950 thought can machines think . later 1980s adoption expert systems companies around world booming field ai initiated. initially matter awe everyone see results ai achieve. ai growth past decades exponential transformed way live work solve challenges. ai made impact wide variety areas including healthcare education business many more. but one areas highest impact ai made recently environment climate change. is ai revolutionizing way deal environment climate change ai strengthen climate predictions enable smarter decision making decarbonising industries building transport work allocate renewable energy. in recent years ai game changer many people well organizations deal climate change. microsoft believes artificial intelligence often encompassing machine learning deep learning game changer climate change environmental issues. the company ai earth program committed 50 million five years create test new applications ai. ai increasingly used manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid handle power fluctuations improve energy storage well. wind companies using ai get turbine propeller produce electricity per rotation incorporating real time weather operational data. ai also improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters internet things internet computing devices embedded everyday objects enabling send receive data forecast energy demand. besides artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws building ordinances flood plains help urban planning disaster preparedness. one vision sustainable city create urban dashboard consisting real time data energy water use availability traffic weather make cities energy efficient livable. hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well. data sensors field monitor crop moisture soil composition temperature help ai improve production know crops need watering. incorporating information drones also used monitor conditions help increasingly automatic ai systems know best times plant spray harvest crops head diseases problems. this result increased efficiency enhanced yields lower use water fertilizer pesticides. but ai good looks downside when talk effect ai environment climate sides coin must elucidated. so apart positives discussed usage ai also downside. last year world economic forum report showed ai address earth environmental challenges important manage properly. according forum experts field ai potential accelerate environmental degradation. the use power intensive gpus run machine learning training already cited contributing increased c02 emissions. although ai around half century question environmental impact ethical issues arising techniques developed decades used combination explosion data strong computational power. for advances enabled artificial intelligence speech recognition self driving cars ai systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate changing carbon emissions. a study last year found training shelf ai language processing system produced 1 400 pounds emissions amount produced flying one person roundtrip new york san francisco. but ways make machine learning cleaner greener movement called green ai. some algorithms less power hungry others example many training sessions moved remote locations get power renewable sources. the key however ai developers companies know much machine learning experiments spewing much volumes could reduced. what done to prevent proposition world economic forum report advancements safe ai pursued ensure humanity developing ai harmful environment. specifically world economic forum said report ai developers must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension. this means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources beyond sustainable among factors. in sense programs need designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind. in future development ai programs also important note environmental impact creating systems first place. according academic study energy usage deep learning processes creation effective ai might costly environment. nearly 300 000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model. this basically equal emissions five average cars united states. considering negative environmental impact addition positive implications ai climate change crucial moving forward. there always room improvement pioneers machine learning recently published paper called tackling climate change machine learning discussed major ai conference. david rolnick postdoctoral fellow university pennsylvania said call arms means bring researchers together. this paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning used including energy production co2 removal education solar geoengineering finance many more. the main idea build energy efficient buildings creating new low carbon materials high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources. artificial intelligence machine learning medium real work done us caretaker mother earth. how better forecasting climate change the kick start already done climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science. it covers wide range topics like improving prediction extreme events hurricanes paleoclimatology collecting data ice cores climate scaling impact us. there lot uncertainty monteleoni claire monteleoni computer science professor university colorado concludes ai ml models generally forecast short term. there significant difference comes long term forecasting. the first system developed princeton 1960s. all ai ml models developed till revolve around atmosphere oceans land cryosphere ice. ai help achieve new heights amount data collected point time compute complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms. what showing effects extreme weather we know climate change real rise atmospheric temperature proof make realistic montreal institute learning algorithms mila microsoft conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know gans simulate mother earth look like rising sea levels atmospheric temperature air pollution intensive storms. our goal convince people climate change real get people believe real said victor schmidt co author paper ph.d. candidate mila the project deployed people look places look like future significant climate change. can track carbon emissions short answer yes. tracking carbon emission one agendas un. for year 2020 un goal prevent new coal plants built. satellite images come picture using deep learning techniques data science researchers analyze high quality satellite images track emission. google expanding horizon nonprofit satellite imagery including gas powered plants emissions used researchers track pollution. there countries organizations govern co2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations. ai automate analysis images power plants get regular updates emissions. it also introduces new ways measure plant impact crunching numbers nearby infrastructure electricity use. that beneficial gas powered plants easy measure plumes coal powered plants have. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth global insights big data data driven dashboards applications development information management organizations
