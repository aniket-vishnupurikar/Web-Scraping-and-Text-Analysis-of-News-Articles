code review checklist the way work done destined undergo massive transformational changes impact humans ways working dramatically. with development new machine programs a.i. set take humans workplace did. now competition beings robots too. and robots overcome us fields work. at present surrounded a.i. dusk till dawn facial recognition present mobile application dating websites applications uses decision making algorithms learn past data well. it believed a.i. grown 270 last years. first let us know a.i. fuss going a.i. defined internet simply simulation human intelligence machines programmed think like humans mimic actions . this translates work human fast speed 100 accuracy.in definition i would define a.i. god form human beings. now question arises a.i. entails future a.i. fancy enough continue existing minds time come certain limitations threats cause peaceful sleep workers. with introduction different areas workplace clear half human jobs would taken a.i. would arise need jobs humans new upcoming ai based ventures different industries. thereby giving us fair share back us. in survey found believed ai devastating humans professionals tech savvy people believed inculcating ai technology business daily lives would remarkable step lead flourishment business future give competitive edge rivals. people believed advanced technologies would come together work humans produce smarter strategic decision productive collaborative practices. more modern technology prevailing organization lead stress reduction produce satisfying results thereby making organization efficient. the organizations use ai technology responds saying managers comfortable using a.i. accustomed organizations looking forward integration higher end technology systems believed new technology result productivity thereby making profits long run. many jobs today require ai humans working collaboration creates positive signal future humans would working closely technology. beyond training developing machines humans would working close vicinity making decisions act result given machine. it said ai advanced technology human remain workforce without technology produce accurate top notch results requires someone make delivery.e.g. firm ai based system produces results based historical data need someone analyze communicate present data respective stakeholders whether inside outside organization. various uses artificial intelligence technology day day functions regards interactions humans artificial intelligence know works algorithms neural networks deep learning analytical tools help ai taking analytical decisions based data provided. whereas humans hand take higher level decisions based intuition sometimes refers gut feeling generates humans concerning situation challenge. ai alone work handle critical situations needs humans reciprocate share information stakeholders humans alone anticipate much accurate fast paced analytical solutions problems persisting place situation. the strength humans ai working synergy surprisingly beneficial advantageous organizations. it believed machines future would eating traditional jobs. but reality seems turning otherwise. the future trend shows future ai powered technology would take jobs done humans return would produce jobs would require human interference them. as newer technology approaching countries proceeding towards gig economies future witness increase freelance jobs permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically. some jobs today replaced ai transportation retail commerce sector 100 automated future years. there amazon go store uses technology goes name just walk technology wherein need human induced workforce operations carried ai powered technologies indeed breakthrough technology today world. rather eating jobs ai return creating jobs future creating massive innovations thereby fueling many new industries thereby giving us fair share jobs back. there lot demand placed upcoming young workforce also categorized gen z . they expected know technology would high demand. these young generations required learn new skills needed survive dynamic changing environment activities carried workers automated demand people working back office maintaining developing technology best versions. ai powered technology limitations makes rigid system hold also makes costly affair initial stage. it predicted cost electricity power supercharged ai model around 4.6 million. so super powered ai purchased big fortune firms thereby creating value net worth. one major limitations ai contain biased data scientists put data create biasedness resultant output would biased report. these machines neuroscience based technology yet enables carry human emotions understand complex situations creative way tend lack box thinking case rigid programmed work single task cannot perform single task time. it also believed exists creativity among computer matter fast paced intelligent. businesses organizations need understand anticipate opportunities future holds need start training employees based today dynamic changing technology. while still unclear future holds us anticipation could benefit us several ways. as unclear future looks like need think probable terms could turn employ specific training programs employees organization.the training employees needed done continuous lifetime basis means education limited pg degrees lifetime process learning. as covid 19 changed scenario work patterns around world need think strategically working dynamics future look like compared pre covid post covid scenario. employees playing major role transforming organizations work practices upcoming future organizations need select recruit best candidates among pool provide best practices new machines make proficient area work. policies need developed hire best people retaining talent organization. there needs continuous scanning environment organizations comprehend new trends assess trends beneficial organizations must aware prospects plan future systematically consistently. there lies possibility future certain years could machines general human intelligence would able answer deep meaningful questions asking why curtains blue would able clean cars play politics tell jokes us using deep machine learning programs level intelligence would beyond mathematical calculations us. that good machines future make competitive machines would need train impending ambiguous future ahead us. humans machines need work synergy get beneficial satisfying results parties. machines indeed going take away many jobs let make sleep peacefully tonight machines arriving retired. we provide intelligence accelerate innovation implement technology extraordinary breadth depth
