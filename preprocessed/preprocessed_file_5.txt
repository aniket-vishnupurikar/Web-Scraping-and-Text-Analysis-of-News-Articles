application code review checklist where disruptive technology taking us take leave disruptive technology always creates new jobs much depleted jobs. you might notice certain jobs disappearing jobs jobs transform humans robots machines technology creating machines replace them. technology creates data analysis tools manipulate create custom scenarios using artificial intelligence ai big data machine learning ml algorithms predict drive consumer behavior. data analytics tools google analytics others available today free used correctly help organizations save millions maybe billions dollars sales marketing. before i go i think best level set constitutes machines. in context article machines describe computers computerized equipment like robots programmed learn sometimes like humans. occasionally call artificial intelligence ai times call machine learning still times call robotics. and yes technically different things. these bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day. they really tough tasks considered difficult human being. but within broad discussion related future work totally interrelated. factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside them. a machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily them. but every forward step advancement technology threat proliferating threat replaced work front. every passing day sealing jobs humans globe. similarly ai used turn hand drawn sketches done humans digital source code. companies clearly developing ai robotics expertise idea technological innovations able of course machines creatives working together either. in another example amazon employed 100 000 robots warehouses efficiently move things around increased warehouse workforce 80 000. humans amazon case picking packing goods robots move orders around giant warehouses essentially cutting walking required workers making amazon pickers efficient less tired. plus robots allow amazon pack shelves together like cars rush hour traffic longer need aisle space humans. the greater density shelf space means inventory one roof means better selection customers. during next decades maybe sooner notion work whether handled human virtual hinge predictability. as starting today machines manage routine humans take unpredictable tasks require creativity problem solving flexibility. in context robotics seen means improve operations efficiency also improve quality life workers. although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation also true highly repetitive tasks even mechanical ones ideal robots. besides greater efficiency speed automation leads lower risk accidents greater control autonomy fewer costs organizations. although artificial intelligence machine learning make us believe robots endowed superior intelligence fact yet ability learn experience respond unknowns. so things stand however much processing speed automatic learning robot beat factors innate human brain. humans still essential part process. think delivering services client. most customer challenges routine humans play important role addressing new issues solving first time appear consolidating process system. while machines humans placed proximity robots expensive apply types especially based robotic process automation rpa development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs. moreover think domestic robots vacuum cleaner lawn mower pool cleaner increasingly part daily lives. this level consumption robotics attained makes affordable automate tasks modern homes obtain greater control security comfort. the division humans machines clear i machine boundary getting fuzzier. smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly bodies making lost limbs providing additional strength stability resilience seen exoskeletons donned assembly line workers. we use smartphones symbiotically integrated directly bodies think smartphone form contact lens capable transparently delivering augmented reality images straight brain. think sounds like science fiction think again. the first prototypes already built. soon brain computer interfaces could become seamless well creating new synergistic relationship cloud us. at point question knows would moot ask question i know answer. sometimes answer stored neural circuitry time would come connection neurons web. our brain decision process influenced way educated cultural context. these external factors influencing decision processes point certain situations legitimately claim influence strong brains held accountable choices made. the point i trying make humans symbiosis cultural environment tools physical conceptual taught use. my guess transformation subtle. practically speaking robots growing point take world start creating smarter better robots impractical even concern. none expected near future long shot. if atm waited pc boot catastrophic failure game crash x box
