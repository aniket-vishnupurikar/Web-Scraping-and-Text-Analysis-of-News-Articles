application code review checklist introduction if anything kills 10 million people next decades highly infectious virus rather war. not missiles microbes. bill gates remarks ted conference 2014 right world avoided ebola outbreak. when new unprecedented invisible virus hit us met overwhelmed unprepared healthcare system oblivious population. this public health emergency demonstrated lack scientific consideration underlined alarming need robust innovations health medical facilities. for past years artificial intelligence proven tangible potential healthcare sectors clinical practices translational medical biomedical research. after first case detected china december 31st 2019 ai program developed bluedot alerted world pandemic. it quick realise ai ability analyse large chunks data could help detecting patterns identifying tracking possible carriers virus. many tracing apps use ai keep tabs people infected prevent risk cross infection using ai algorithms track patterns extract features classify categorise them. so ai ibm watson sophisticated ai works cloud computing natural language processing prominently contributed healthcare sector global level. being conversational ai since 2013 watson helped recommending treatments patients suffering cancer ensure get best treatment optimum costs. researchers google inc. showed ai system trained thousands images achieve physician level sensitivity. by identifying molecular patterns associated disease status subtypes gene expression protein abundance levels machine learning methods detect fatal diseases like cancer early stage. machine learning ml techniques focus mainly analyzing structured data help clustering patients traits infer probability disease outcomes. since patient traits mainly include masses data relating age gender disease history disease specific data like diagnostic imaging gene expressions etc ml extract features data inputs constructing data analytical algorithms. ml algorithms either supervised unsupervised. unsupervised learning helps extracting features clustering similar features together leads early detection diseases. clustering principal component analysis enable grouping clustering similar traits together used maximize minimize similarity patients within clusters. since patient traits recorded multiple dimensions genes principal component analysis pca creates apparatus reduce dimensions humans could done alone. supervised learning considers outcomes subjects together traits correlates inputs outputs predict probability getting particular clinical event expected value disease level expected survival time risk down syndrome. biomarker panels mostly used detect ovarian cancer outperformed conventional statistical methods due machine learning. in addition use ehrs bayesian networks part supervised machine learning algorithms predict clinical outcomes mortality respectively. unstructured data clinical notes texts converted machine readable structured data help natural language processing nlp . nlp works two components text processing classification. text processing helps identifying series disease relevant keywords clinical notes classification categorized normal abnormal cases. chest screening ml nlp helped find abnormalities lungs provide treatment covid patients. healthcare organizations use nlp based chatbots increase interactions patients keeping mental health wellness check. deep learning modern extension classical neural network techniques helps explore complex non linear patterns data using algorithms like convolution neural network recurrent neural network deep belief network deep neural network enables accurate clinical prediction. when comes genome interpretation deep neural networks surpass conventional methods logistics regression support vector machines. sepsis watch ai system trained deep learning algorithms holds capability analyze 32 million data points create patient risk score identify early stages sepsis. another method known learning based optimization under sampling pattern loupe based integrating full resolution mri scans convolutional neural network algorithm helps creating accurate

technologies help exploring roles relationships various branches ending suffix omics genomics proteomics etc. omics based tests based machine learning algorithms help find correlations predict treatment responses ultimately creating personalized treatments individual patients. how helps psychology neuro patients for psychologists studying creativity ai promising new classes experiments developing data structures programs exploring novel theories new horizon. studies show ai conduct therapy sessions e therapy sessions assessments autonomously also assisting human practitioners sessions. the detection computational analysis psychological signal project uses ml computer vision nlp analyze language physical gestures social signals identify cues human distress. this ground breaking technology assesses soldiers returning combat recognizes require mental health support. in future combine data captured face face interviews information sleeping eating online behaviours complete patient view. stroke identification stroke another frequently occurring disease affects 500 million people worldwide. thrombus vessel cerebral infarction major 85 cause stroke occurrence. in recent years ai techniques used numerous stroke related studies early detection timely treatment along efficient outcome prediction help solve problem. with ai disposal large amounts data rich information complications real life clinical questions addressed arena. currently two ml algorithms genetic fuzzy finite state machine pca implemented build model building solution. these include human activity recognition stage stroke onset detection stage. an alert stroke message activated soon movement significantly different normal pattern recorded. ml methods applied neuroimaging data assist disease evaluation predicting stroke treatment diagnosis. patient monitoring today market ai based patient monitoring impressive monetarily enticing. it evolving artificial sensors smart technologies explores everything brain computer interfaces nanorobotics. companies smart watches engaged people perform remote monitoring even patients . an obvious place start wearable embedded sensors glucose monitors pulse monitors oximeters ecg monitors. with patient monitoring becoming crucial ai finds numerous applications chronic conditions intensive care units operating rooms emergency rooms cardiac wards timeless clinical decision making measured seconds. more advances started gain traction like smart prosthetics implants. these play impeccable role patient management post surgery rehabilitation. demographics laboratory results vital signs also used predict cardiac arrest transfer intensive care unit even death. in addition interpretable machine learning model assist anesthesiologists predicting hypoxaemia events surgery. this suggests deep learning algorithms raw patient monitoring data could better used avoid information overload alert overload enabling accurate clinical prediction timely decision making. conclusion considering vast range tasks ai evident holds deep potential improving patient outcomes skyrocketing levels. using sophisticated algorithms ai bring revolution healthcare sector. even facing challenges like whether technology able deliver promises ethical measures training physicians use standard regulations etc role ai
