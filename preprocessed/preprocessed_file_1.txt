never defeated him. it rule power betterment skills granted supremacy. were ai machines tools equipment something helped unskilled person mind intelligence creates something could skilled work perfection precision well initially however time passed humans got drawn puzzle ai lot changed. human research went deeper deeper result machines evolved it. at present ai machines growing field. as develops improves become part industrial revolution. in industries laborious work taken care humans replaced machines. naturally evolution machines precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies factors made better choice. a choice humans. this led fear fear distant future future maybe machines evolved take need human employee leading unemployment. with population increase around world became new tech threat labor market. then true does ai really oppose threat will adapting technology make millions people lose jobs will lead mass unemployment will machines really surpass humans will creation take creator no matter fearful future ai may seem reality scary. truth ai present reality key holds power unlock whole next level human evolution. technology growing. there time
